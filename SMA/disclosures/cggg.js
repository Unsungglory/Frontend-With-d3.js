MSCI World Index through 09/30/2011 and the MSCI All Country World Index, the 
fund’s current primary benchmark, thereafter. MSCI World Index is a free float-
adjusted market capitalization weighted index that is designed to measure equity 
market results of developed markets. The index consists of more than 20 developed
market country indexes, including the United States. MSCI All Country World Index 
is a free float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index that is designed to 
measure equity market results in the global developed and emerging markets. The 
index consists of more than 40 developed and emerging market country indexes. 
Results reflect dividends net of withholding taxes WITH Index reflects MSCI World 
Index from composite inception until September 30, 2011, and MSCI All Country 
World Index (ACWI) from October 1, 2011, to present. These indexes are 
unmanaged, and their results include reinvested dividends and/or distributions but 
do not reflect the effect of sales charges, commissions, account fees, expenses or 
U.S. federal income taxes. Investors cannot invest directly in an index.

Lifetime: as of 4/1/73. The Capital Group Global Growth SMA Composite inception is 
July 1, 2017. The composite consists of all unrestricted, discretionary separately 
managed account SMA portfolios that are managed according to the Global Growth 
strategy. Beginning July 1, 2017, the Capital Group Global Growth SMA Composite 
includes all SMA portfolios applicable to the Global Growth strategy. Prior to 
July 1, 2017, no SMA portfolios were managed in the Global Growth strategy, and 
for that reason, the results presented are based on Capital Group New Perspective 
Composite (inception is April 1, 1973) returns, which contain non-SMA similar 
strategy portfolios. As of January 1, 2019, only unrestricted portfolios are 
included in the composite. Prior to January 1, 2019, both restricted and 
unrestricted portfolios were included. Past results are not predictive of 
results in future periods.

Net returns are calculated by subtracting a monthly hypothetical fee (equivalent to 
3% annual, which is equal to or higher than the highest actual SMA fee charged by a
program sponsor) from ”pure” gross composite monthly returns. Actual fees will 
vary. For information concerning program sponsor fees, contact your financial 
advisor. Excess return represents the mean annualized premium/deficit between 
the results for the stated equity service composite and the respective benchmark 
for all rolling one-year periods in which the market delivered the referenced level of 
returns (index return 15%; index return of >15%). Numbers are based on rolling 
monthly data for both the composite and the respective benchmark in order to 
represent the broadest range of beginning and ending points available and reduce 
entry- and exit-point bias, thus reflecting the range of entry points experienced by 
investors. 
<br><br>
Rolling returns are based on monthly observations since the inception date of the 
composite. Results are net of withholding taxes on dividends, interest and capital 
gains. Information regarding the fees charged by program sponsors for SMA 
portfolios included in this composite is available in the relevant program sponsor’s 
Form ADV or other relevant disclosure materials in the non-U.S. markets. Past 
performance does not guarantee future results.
