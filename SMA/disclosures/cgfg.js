Lifetime: as of December 1, 1973. Capital Group U.S. Flexible Growth SMA Composite inception: October 1, 2020. The composite consists of all unrestricted, discretionary SMA portfolios that are managed according to its investment strategy. Prior to October 1, 2020, no SMA portfolios were managed in the U.S. Flexible Growth strategy, and for that reason, the results presented are based on Capital Group Growth Fund of America Composite (inception is December 1, 1973) returns, which contain non-SMA similar strategy portfolios. Investment results assume all distributions are reinvested and reflect applicable fees and expenses.
<br><br>
Standard & Poor’s 500 Composite Index is a market capitalization-weighted index 
based on the results of approximately 500 widely held common stocks. Indexes are 
unmanaged and, therefore, have no expenses. Investors cannot invest directly in an
index.

Gross composite results do not reflect the deduction of fees and expenses; results would have been lower if they were subject to fees and expenses.
<br><br>
Net returns are calculated by subtracting a monthly hypothetical fee (equivalent to 3% annual, which is equal to or higher than the highest actual 
SMA fee charged by a program sponsor) from ”pure” gross composite monthly returns. Actual fees will vary. For information concerning program 
sponsor fees, contact your financial advisor. Excess return represents the mean annualized premium/deficit between the results for the stated 
equity service composite and the respective benchmark for all rolling one-year periods in which the market delivered the referenced level of 
returns (index return 15%; index return of >15%). Numbers are based on rolling monthly data for both the composite and the respective benchmark 
in order to represent the broadest range of beginning and ending points available and reduce entry- and exit-point bias, thus reflecting the 
range of entry points experienced by investors.
<br><br>
Rolling returns are based on monthly observations since the inception date of the composite. Results are net of withholding taxes on dividends, 
interest and capital gains. Information regarding the fees charged by program sponsors for SMA portfolios included in this composite is available 
in the relevant program sponsor’s Form ADV or other relevant disclosure materials in the non-U.S. markets. Past performance does not guarantee future results.
