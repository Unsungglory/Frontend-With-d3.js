Lifetime: as of 8/1/52. The Capital Group U.S. Income and Growth SMA Composite inception is September 1, 2016. The composite consists of all unrestricted, discretionary separately managed account SMA portfolios that are managed according to the U.S. Income and Growth strategy. Beginning September 1, 2016, the Capital Group U.S. Income and Growth SMA Composite includes all SMA portfolios applicable to the U.S. Income and Growth strategy. Prior to September 1, 2016, no SMA portfolios were managed in the U.S. Income and Growth strategy, and for that reason, the results presented are based on Capital Group Washington Mutual Composite (inception is August 1, 1952) returns, which contain non-SMA similar strategy portfolios. Prior to January 1, 2019, both restricted and unrestricted portfolios were included. As of January 1, 2019, only unrestricted portfolios are included in the composite. Prior to January 1, 2019, both restricted and unrestricted portfolios were included. Past results are not predictive of results in future periods.

Standard & Poor’s 500 Composite Index is a market capitalization-weighted index based on the results of approximately 500 widely held common stocks. Indexes are unmanaged and, therefore, have no expenses. Investors cannot invest
directly in an index.

“Pure” gross composite returns do not reflect the deduction of any trading costs, fees or expenses; results would have been lower if they were subject to fees and expenses.
<br><br>
Net returns are calculated by subtracting a monthly hypothetical fee (equivalent to 3% annual, which is equal to or higher than the highest actual SMA fee charged by a program sponsor) from ”pure” gross composite monthly returns. Actual fees will vary. For information concerning program sponsor fees, contact your financial advisor. Excess return represents the mean annualized premium/deficit between the results for the stated equity service composite and the respective benchmark for all rolling one-year periods in which the market delivered the referenced level of returns (index return 15%; index return of >15%). Numbers are based on rolling monthly data for both the composite and the respective benchmark in order to represent the broadest range of beginning and ending points available and reduce entry- and exit-point bias, thus reflecting the range of entry points experienced by investors.
<br><br>
Rolling returns are based on monthly observations since the inception date of the composite. Results are net of withholding taxes on dividends, interest and capital gains. Information regarding the fees charged by program sponsors for SMA portfolios included in this composite is available in the relevant program sponsor’s Form ADV or other relevant disclosure materials in the non-U.S. markets. Past performance does not guarantee future result
