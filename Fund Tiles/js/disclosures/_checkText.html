Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained
from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing.
Investing outside the United States involves risks, such as currency fluctuations, periods of illiquidity and price volatility. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in developing countries.
For more information about the risks associated with each investment, go to its detailed information page or read the prospectus, if applicable.
Class A shares of the fund include seed money invested by the fund’s investment adviser or its affiliates. Because 12b-1 fees are not paid on these investments, expenses are lower and results are higher than they would have been if the fees had
been paid.
The return of principal for bond portfolios and for portfolios with significant underlying bond holdings is not guaranteed. Fund shares are subject to the same interest rate, inflation and credit risks associated with the underlying bond holdings.
Lower rated bonds are subject to greater fluctuations in value and risk of loss of income and principal than higher rated bonds.
The use of derivatives involves a variety of risks, which may be different from, or greater than, the risks associated with investing in traditional cash securities, such as stocks and bonds.
There may have been periods when the results lagged the index(es). Certain market indexes are unmanaged and, therefore, have no expenses. Investors cannot invest directly in an index.
Portfolios are managed, so holdings will change. Certain fixed income and/or cash and equivalents holdings may be held through mutual funds managed by the investment adviser or its affiliates that are not offered to the public.
Investment results assume all distributions are reinvested and reflect applicable fees and expenses unless otherwise noted. Returns for one year or less are not annualized, but calculated as cumulative total returns. The expense ratios are as of each
fund’s prospectus available at the time of publication.
The investment adviser is currently reimbursing a portion of other expenses. This reimbursement will be in effect through at least March 1, 2022, without which the results would have been lower and net expense ratios higher. The adviser may elect
at its discretion to extend, modify or terminate the reimbursement at that time.
When applicable, results reflect fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements, without which they would have been lower and net expense ratios higher if shown. This information is provided in detail in the prospectus. Please see capitalgroup.com
for more information.

Fi360 Methodology
The Fi360 Fiduciary Score is a peer percentile ranking of an investment against a set of quantitative due diligence criteria selected to reflect prudent fiduciary management. The Fi360 Fiduciary Score should not be used as the sole source of
information in an investment decision. Visit www.fi360.com/FiduciaryScore for the complete methodology document. Score 0: No fiduciary due diligence shortfalls. Score 1–25: The investment may be an appropriate choice for use in a fiduciary
account. Score 26–50: The investment has noteworthy shortfalls. It may not be an appropriate choice if being considered in a search. However, if already in use, the investment may not need to be replaced if mitigating circumstances are present.
Score 51–75: The investment has considerable shortfalls. It may not be an appropriate choice if being considered in a search. However, if already in use, the investment may not need to be replaced pending further investigation or if the score
improves in subsequent time periods. Score 76–100: The investment has significant shortfalls and may not be appropriate for use in a fiduciary account. Strongly consider replacing the investment if already in use. Fi360 Fiduciary Score is a

The FiRM default score is based on an evaluation of 10 equally weighted factors, representing the most popular evaluation factors used by FiRM customers. Each factor is assessed using a meets/does not meet pass/fail assessment, and is
evaluated using data as of the most recently completed calendar quarter. The default criteria do not include an overall meets/does not meet evaluation, nor a Watch/Replace evaluation. Instead, it is up to the advisor or plan sponsor to consider this
score, score history and other qualitative factors to make that decision. Evaluation criteria included in the default criteria include: Manager Tenure and Fund Age>/=3 years, Total net assets>100 Million, 3- and 5-year performance>/= 50% of peers,
5-year Up Capture>Down Capture, 3- and 5-year Sharpe Ratio>/=50% of peers, 3-year Beta </=1, and Net Expense Ratio </= 50% of peers. Scores are not provided for funds with less than five years of history. Please reference the FiRM website at
www.fi360.com/FirmPlusCriteria for additional information and disclosures. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.
Retirement Plan Advisory Group (RPAG) Scorecard SystemTM incorporates both quantitative and qualitative factors into evaluating investment managers and investment strategies. The scoring system is built around pass/fail criteria, on a scale of
0–10, ranking active, passive and asset allocation strategies. Eighty percent of the investment’s score is quantitative, incorporating modern portfolio theory statistics, quadratic optimization analysis and peer group rankings. The other 20% considers
manager tenure, expense ratio relative to the asset class average and the investment’s strength of statistics. The rankings are on a scale of 1–10. A score of 9–10 warrants adding a fund to a plan lineup. Scores of 7–8 indicate funds are acceptable
and may be maintained in plans. Scores of 5–6 indicate funds warranting placement on a watch list. Scores of 0–4 indicate funds warranting removal. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.
