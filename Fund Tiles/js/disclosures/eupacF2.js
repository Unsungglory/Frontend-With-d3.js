            Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the

          Investing outside the United States involves risks, such as currency fluctuations, periods of illiquidity and price volatility. 
          These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in developing countries.

          Class F-2 shares were ﬁrst offered on August 1, 2008. Class F-2 share results prior to the date of ﬁrst sale are hypothetical based on the results of the original share class of the fund without a sales charge, adjusted for typical estimated expenses. Results for certain funds with an inception date after August 1, 2008, also include hypothetical returns because those funds’ Class F-2 shares sold after the funds’ date of ﬁrst offering.

          Returns shown for indexes include reinvested dividends. There may have been periods when the results lagged the index(es). Certain market indexes are unmanaged and, therefore, have no expenses. Investors cannot invest directly in an index. 

          <br><br>
          Portfolios are managed, so holdings will change. Certain ﬁxed income and/or cash and equivalents holdings may be held through mutual funds managed by the investment adviser or its afﬁliates that are not offered to the public. 

          <br><br>
          Investment results assume all distributions are reinvested and reﬂect applicable fees and expenses unless otherwise noted. Returns for one year or less are not annualized, but calculated as cumulative total returns. The expense ratios are as of each fund’s prospectus available at the time of publication.

          <br><br>
          When applicable, investment results reflect fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements, without which results would have been lower and net expense ratios higher if shown. 
          This information is provided in detail in the prospectus. Please see <span style='text-decoration: underline; cursor: pointer;' onclick='goWeb()'>capitalgroup.com</span> for more information.

            Capture ratio downside: Ratio of a fund’s return during the periods when the index was down, divided by the return of the index during those periods. For example, during periods when the index was down, a down-capture ratio greater than 100 indicates the fund produced a lower return than the index. 
            <br>
            Capture ratio upside: Ratio of a fund’s return during the periods when the index was up, divided by the return of the index during those periods. For example, an up-capture ratio greater than 100 indicates the fund produced a higher return than the index during periods when the index was up.

            Figures include convertible securities; totals may not reconcile due to rounding. Methodology notes: The equity breakdown by revenue reflects the portfolio’s publicly traded equity holdings and excludes cash (and fixed income securities, if applicable). Underlying revenue data were compiled by MSCI and account for disparities in the way companies report their revenues across geographic segments. MSCI breaks out each company’s reported revenues into country-by-country estimates. MSCI provides revenue data figures based on a proprietary, standardized model. Revenue exposure at the portfolio and index level was calculated by using FactSet, which takes these company revenue exposures and multiplies by the company’s weighting in the portfolio and index. In this breakdown, Israel has been included in Europe.

                        Both fund and index annualized returns reﬂect the average of the average annual total returns for all periods. Data from published sources were calculated internally. 
                        Fund returns, which are based on Class F-2 shares, are from the ﬁrst month-end following each fund’s inception date through December 31, 2020. Class F-2 shares were ﬁrst offered on August 1,2008. Class F-2 share results prior to the date of ﬁrst sale are hypothetical based on the results of the original share class of the fund without a sales charge, adjusted for typical estimated expenses.

Data are not shown for periods when funds were not in existence. There have been periods when the fund has lagged the index. The percentage of periods funds outpaced the index were calculated based on the total return.

          Morningstar foreign large-growth portfolios focus on high-priced growth stocks, mainly outside of the United States. These portfolios primarily invest in stocks that have market caps in the top 70% of each economically integrated market (such as Europe or Asia ex-Japan). Growth is defined based on fast growth (high growth rates for earnings, ales, book value, and cash flow) and high valuations (high price ratios and low dividend yields). These portfolios typically will have less than 20% of assets invested in U.S. stocks.
