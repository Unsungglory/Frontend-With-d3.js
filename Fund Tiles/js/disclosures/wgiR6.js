    Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so
    they may lose value.

  Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing.

<br><br>
Investing outside the United States involves risks, such as currency fluctuations, periods of illiquidity and price volatility. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in developing countries. 

<br><br>
For more information about the risks associated with each investment, go to its detailed information page or read the prospectus, if applicable.

American Funds offers a range of share classes designed to meet the needs of retirement plan sponsors and participants. The different share classes incorporate varying levels of advisor compensation and service provider payments. Because Class R-6 shares do not include any recordkeeping payments, expenses are lower and results are higher. Other share classes that include recordkeeping costs have higher expenses and lower results than Class R-6. 

<br><br>
Class R-6 shares were first offered on May 1, 2009. Class R-6 share results prior to the date of first sale are hypothetical based on Class A share results without a sales charge, adjusted for typical estimated expenses. Please see each fund’s prospectus for more information on specific expenses. 

<br><br>
There may have been periods when the results lagged the index(es). Certain market indexes are unmanaged and, therefore, have no expenses. Investors cannot invest directly in an index. 

<br><br>
Portfolios are managed, so holdings will change. Certain ﬁxed income and/or cash and equivalents holdings may be held through mutual funds managed by the investment adviser or its afﬁliates that are not offered to the public.

<br><br>
Investment results assume all distributions are reinvested and reﬂect applicable fees and expenses unless otherwise noted. Returns for one year or less are not annualized, but calculated as cumulative total returns. The expense ratios are as of each fund’s prospectus available at the time of publication. 

<br><br>
When applicable, investment results reflect fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements, without which results would have been lower and net expense ratios higher if shown. This information is provided in detail in the prospectus.

  Figures include convertible securities; totals may not reconcile due to rounding. Methodology notes: The equity breakdown by revenue reflects the portfolio’s publicly traded equity holdings and excludes cash (and fixed income securities, if applicable). Underlying revenue data were compiled by MSCI and account for disparities in the way companies report their revenues across geographic segments. MSCI breaks out each company’s reported revenues into country-by-country estimates. MSCI provides revenue data figures based on a proprietary, standardized model. Revenue exposure at the portfolio and index level was calculated by using FactSet, which takes these company revenue exposures and multiplies by the company’s weighting in the portfolio and index. In this breakdown, Israel has been included in Europe.

  The Morningstar Ownership Zone™ provides detail about a portfolio’s equity investment style by showing the range of stock sizes and styles. A portfolio’s Ownership Zone™ is derived by plotting each stock in the fund’s portfolio within the proprietary Morningstar Style Box™. The shaded area represents the center 75% of the fund’s assets, and it provides an intuitive visual representation of the area of the market in which the fund invests. A “centroid” plot in the middle of the Ownership Zone represents the weighted average of all the fund’s holdings. A fund that is concentrated will have a small ownership zone relative to the area of the style box, and broadly diversified fund will have an ownership zone that stretches across many sizes and style. Over a period of time, the shape and location of a fund’s ownership zone may vary. The model for the fixed-income style box is based on the two pillars of fixed-income performance: interest-rate sensitivity and credit quality. The three interest sensitivity groups are limited, moderate and extensive and the three credit quality groups are high, medium and low. These groupings display a portfolio’s effective duration and third party credit ratings to provide an overall representation of the fund’s risk orientation given the sensitivity to interest rate and credit rating of bonds in the portfolio.

MSCI All Country World Index is a free float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index that is designed to measure equity market results in the global developed and emerging markets, consisting of more than 40 developed and emerging market country indexes. Results reflect dividends gross of withholding taxes through December 31, 2000, and dividends net of withholding taxes thereafter. This index is unmanaged, and its results include reinvested dividends and/or distributions but do not reflect the effect of sales charges, commissions, account fees, expenses or U.S. federal income taxes.

The Global Large-Stock Blend-stock portfolios have few geographical limitations. It is common for these portfolios to invest the majority of their assets in the U.S., Europe, and Japan, with the remainder divided among the globe’s smaller markets. These portfolios typically have 20%-60% of assets in U.S. stocks.

<div class='r6-footer-big'>Attribution Methodology</div>

<br>
Equity attribution data was produced using FactSet, a third-party software system, based on daily portfolios. Securities in their initial period of acquisition may not be included in this analysis. The analysis includes equity investments only and excludes forward contracts and fixed-income investments, if applicable. It does not account for buy and sell transactions that might have occurred intraday. As a result, average portfolio weight percentages are approximate and the actual average portfolio weight percentages might be higher or lower. Data elements such as pricing, income, market cap, etc., were provided by FactSet. The index provided for attribution is based on FactSet’s methodology. The index is a broad-based market benchmark and may not be used by Capital Group as the sole comparative index for this fund. Capital believes the software and information from FactSet to be reliable. However, Capital cannot be responsible for inaccuracies, incomplete information or updating of information by FactSet. 

<br><br>
Relative contribution measures the impact a security has on the portfolio’s excess return (the portfolio return minus the benchmark return). Past results are not indicative of results in future periods. 

<br><br>
Cash and equivalents includes short-term securities, accrued income and other assets less liabilities. It may also include investments in money market or similar funds managed by the investment adviser or its affiliates that are not offered to the public.

<div class='r6-footer-big'>Fi360 Methodology</div>

<br>
The Fi360 Fiduciary Score is a peer percentile ranking of an investment against a set of quantitative due diligence criteria selected to reflect prudent fiduciary management. 
The Fi360 Fiduciary Score should not be used as the sole source of information in an investment decision. 
Visit <span class='disclaimer-link bold' onclick='window.open("https://www.fi360.com/FiduciaryScore")'>www.fi360.com/FiduciaryScore</span> for the complete methodology document. 

<span class='bold'>Score 0:</span> No fiduciary due diligence shortfalls. <span class='bold'>Score 1–25:</span> The investment may be an appropriate choice for use in a fiduciary account. 
<span class='bold'>Score 26–50:</span> The investment has noteworthy shortfalls. It may not be an appropriate choice if being considered in a search. However, if already in use, the investment may not need to be replaced if mitigating circumstances are present. 
<span class='bold'>Score 51–75:</span> The investment has considerable shortfalls. It may not be an appropriate choice if being considered in a search. However, if already in use, the investment may not need to be replaced pending further investigation or if the score improves in subsequent time periods. 
<span class='bold'>Score 76–100:</span> The investment has significant shortfalls and may not be appropriate for use in a fiduciary account. Strongly consider replacing the investment if already in use. Fi360 Fiduciary Score is a registered trademark of Fi360, Inc. The Fi360 Fiduciary Score and data are copyright © ${yearVar} Fi360, Inc.

<span class='bold'>The FiRM default score</span> is based on an evaluation of 10 equally weighted factors, representing the most popular evaluation factors used 
by FiRM customers. Each factor is assessed using a meets/does not meet pass/fail assessment, and is evaluated using data as of the most recently 
completed calendar quarter. The default criteria do not include an overall meets/does not meet evaluation, nor a Watch/Replace evaluation. 
Instead, it is up to the advisor or plan sponsor to consider this score, score history and other qualitative factors to make that decision. 
Evaluation criteria included in the default criteria include: Manager Tenure and Fund Age>/=3 years, Total net assets>100 Million, 3- and 5-year 
performance>/= 50% of peers, 5-year Up Capture>Down Capture, 3- and 5-year Sharpe Ratio>/=50% of peers, 3-year 
Beta &lt/=1, and Net Expense Ratio &lt/= 50% of peers. Scores are not provided for funds with less than five years of history.

<br><br>
<span class='bold'>Retirement Plan Advisory Group (RPAG) Scorecard System<sup>TM</sup></span> incorporates both quantitative and qualitative factors into evaluating investment managers and investment strategies. The scoring system is built around pass/fail criteria, on a scale of 0–10, ranking active, passive and asset allocation strategies. Eighty percent of the investment’s score is quantitative, incorporating modern portfolio theory statistics, quadratic optimization analysis and peer group rankings. The other 20% considers manager tenure, expense ratio relative to the asset class average and the investment’s strength of statistics. The rankings are on a scale of 1–10. 
<span class='bold'>A score of 9–10</span> warrants adding a fund to a plan lineup. <span class='bold'>Scores of 7–8</span> indicate funds are acceptable and may be maintained in plans. <span class='bold'>Scores of 5–6</span> indicate funds warranting placement on a watch list. <span class='bold'>Scores of 0–4</span> indicate funds warranting removal. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.
