    Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so
    they may lose value.
</span>

<br><br>
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important
information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained
from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing.
</strong>

<br><br>
Investing outside the United States involves risks, such as currency fluctuations, periods of illiquidity and price
volatility. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in developing countries.
<br><br>

For more information about the risks associated with each investment, go to its detailed information page or read
the prospectus, if applicable.
<br><br>

Class F-2 shares were ﬁrst offered on August 1, 2008. Class F-2 share results prior to the date of ﬁrst sale are 
hypothetical based on the results of the original share class of the fund without a sales charge, adjusted for 
typical estimated expenses. Results for certain funds with an inception date after August 1, 2008, also include 
hypothetical returns because those funds’ Class F-2 shares sold after the funds’ date of ﬁrst offering. 
Please see <span style='text-decoration: underline; cursor: pointer;' onclick='goWeb()'>capitalgroup.com</span> 
for more information on speciﬁc expense adjustments and the actual dates of ﬁrst sale.
<br><br>

The return of principal for bond portfolios and for portfolios with significant underlying bond holdings is not
guaranteed. Fund shares are subject to the same interest rate, inflation and credit risks associated with the
underlying bond holdings.
Lower rated bonds are subject to greater fluctuations in value and risk of loss of income and principal than higher
rated bonds.
<br><br>

The use of derivatives involves a variety of risks, which may be different from, or greater than, the risks
associated with investing in traditional cash securities, such as stocks and bonds.
<br><br>

There may have been periods when the results lagged the index(es). Certain market indexes are unmanaged and,
therefore, have no expenses. Investors cannot invest directly in an index.
<br><br>

Portfolios are managed, so holdings will change. Certain fixed income and/or cash and equivalents holdings may be
held through mutual funds managed by the investment adviser or its affiliates that are not offered to the public.
<br><br>

Investment results assume all distributions are reinvested and reflect applicable fees and expenses unless otherwise
noted. Returns for one year or less are not annualized, but calculated as cumulative total returns. The expense
ratios are as of each
fund’s prospectus available at the time of publication.
<br><br>

The investment adviser is currently reimbursing a portion of other expenses. This reimbursement will be in effect
through at least March 1, 2022, without which the results would have been lower and net expense ratios higher. The
adviser may elect
at its discretion to extend, modify or terminate the reimbursement at that time.
<br><br>

When applicable, results reflect fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements, without which they would have been lower
and net expense ratios higher if shown. This information is provided in detail in the prospectus.
