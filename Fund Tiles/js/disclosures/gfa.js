            Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the 
            fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing.

          Investing outside the United States involves risks, such as currency fluctuations, periods of illiquidity and price volatility. 
          These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in developing countries. 
          
          <br><br>
          For more information about the risks associated with each investment, go to its detailed information page or read the prospectus, if applicable.

          Class A shares were ﬁrst offered on January 1, 1934. Class A share results prior to the date of ﬁrst sale are hypothetical based on the results of the original share class of the fund without a sales charge, adjusted for typical estimated expenses. Please see <span style='text-decoration: underline; cursor: pointer;' onclick='goWeb()'>capitalgroup.com</span> for more information on speciﬁc expense adjustments and the actual dates of ﬁrst sale.

          <br><br>
          Returns shown for indexes include reinvested dividends. There may have been periods when the results lagged the index(es). Certain market indexes are unmanaged and, therefore, have no expenses. 
          Investors cannot invest directly in an index. 

          <br><br>
          Portfolios are managed, so holdings will change. Certain ﬁxed income and/or cash and equivalents holdings may be held through mutual funds managed by the investment adviser or its afﬁliates that are not offered to the public. 

          <br><br>
          Investment results assume all distributions are reinvested and reﬂect applicable fees and expenses unless otherwise noted. Returns for one year or less are not annualized, but calculated as cumulative total returns. The expense ratios are as of each fund’s prospectus available at the time of publication. 

          <br><br>
          When applicable, investment results reflect fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements, without which results would have been lower and net expense ratios higher if shown. 
          This information is provided in detail in the prospectus. Please see <span style='text-decoration: underline; cursor: pointer;' onclick='goWeb()'>capitalgroup.com</span> for more information.

            Capture ratio downside: Ratio of a fund’s return during the periods when the index was down, divided by the return of the index during those periods. For example, during periods when the index was down, a down-capture ratio greater than 100 indicates the fund produced a lower return than the index. 
            <br>
            Capture ratio upside: Ratio of a fund’s return during the periods when the index was up, divided by the return of the index during those periods. For example, an up-capture ratio greater than 100 indicates the fund produced a higher return than the index during periods when the index was up.

            Figures include convertible securities; totals may not reconcile due to rounding. Methodology notes: The equity breakdown by revenue reflects the portfolio’s publicly traded equity holdings and excludes cash (and fixed income securities, if applicable). Underlying revenue data were compiled by MSCI and account for disparities in the way companies report their revenues across geographic segments. MSCI breaks out each company’s reported revenues into country-by-country estimates. MSCI provides revenue data figures based on a proprietary, standardized model. Revenue exposure at the portfolio and index level was calculated by using FactSet, which takes these company revenue exposures and multiplies by the company’s weighting in the portfolio and index. In this breakdown, Israel has been included in Europe.

            Both fund and index annualized returns reflect the average of the average annual total returns for all periods. Data from published sources were calculated internally. 
            Fund returns, which are based on Class A shares at net asset value, are from the first month-end following each fund’s inception date through December 31, 2020, and do not include the maximum sales charge of 5.75%. If a sales charge had been deducted, the results would have been lower. The percentage of periods funds outpaced the index were calculated based on the total return.

          Standard & Poor’s 500 Index is a market capitalization-weighted index based on the results of approximately 500 widely held common stocks. The index is unmanaged, and its results include reinvested dividends, and/or distributions but do not reflect the effect of sales charges, commissions, account fees, expenses or U.S. federal income taxes. 
          
          <br><br>
          Lipper Large-Cap Growth Funds Index is an equally weighted index of funds that invest at least 75% of their equity assets in companies with market capitalizations (on a three-year weighted basis) above Lipper’s U.S. diversified equity large-cap floor. Large-cap growth funds typically have an above-average price-to-earnings ratio, price-to-book ratio, and three-year sales-per-share growth value, compared to the S&P-500 Index. The results of the underlying funds in the index include the reinvestment of dividends and capital gain distributions, as well as brokerage commissions paid by the funds for portfolio transactions and other fund expenses, but do not reflect the effect of sales charges, account fees or U.S. federal income taxes. 

          <br><br>
          Lipper Capital Appreciation Funds Index is an equally weighted index of funds that aim for maximum capital appreciation. The results of the underlying funds in the index include the reinvestment of dividends and capital gain distributions, as well as brokerage commissions paid by the funds for portfolio transactions and other fund expenses, but do not reflect the effect of sales charges, account fees or U.S. federal income taxes. 

          <br><br>
          Lipper Growth Funds Index is an equally weighted index of growth funds, as defined by each fund’s related prospectus. The results of the underlying funds in the index include the reinvestment of dividends and capital gain distributions, as well as brokerage commissions paid by the funds for portfolio transactions and other fund expenses, but do not reflect the effect of sales charges, account fees or U.S. federal income taxes.
